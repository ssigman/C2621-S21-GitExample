# Git Example for Data Structures
## Purpose
The Java code is for a simple Hello World program.  Nothing special in terms of code.  The purpose is to introduce students to using Git.
## Important Git concepts
1.  Clone - The clone command makes a copy of a Git repo in a new place.  In our case, a copy of a remote repo on our local machine.
2.  Add - Add new files or changes to files to the staged storage.
3.  Commit - Saves the changes in the staged storage to your local repo.
4.  Push - Pushes commits back to the remote repo.
